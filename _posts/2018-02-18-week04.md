**Fixing the Website**
I haven't yet submitted a pull request, but I have began working on resolving issue #22. The best image I could find for "Practical Open Source Software Exploration" is:

Just waiting on approval to go ahead and resolve the issue. The exact source of the issue is located at:
https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/b9d1886fb74bcf31973bc547a788fd4de0d628e2/_config.yml#L70  

**CodeTriage**
My experience with CodeTriage so far hasn't been life changing. Possibly because I've only receeived one or two emails so far.  
I signed up for matplotlib and django. I've used both on a handful of occasions (and didn't know either of them were open source until recently).  
Out of the few issues I did examine, the two that caught my interest were:
https://github.com/django/django/pull/9546  
https://github.com/django/django/pull/9351  
In both cases, responses seem to be pretty quick and people encourage using helpful links instead of deterring anyone trying to help.
