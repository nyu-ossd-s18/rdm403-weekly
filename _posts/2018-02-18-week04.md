**Fixing the Website**  
I haven't yet submitted a pull request, but I have began working on resolving issue #22. The best image I could find for "Practical Open Source Software Exploration" is:  
https://quaid.fedorapeople.org/TOS/Practical_Open_Source_Software_Exploration/html-single/Common_Content/images/title_logo.svg  
Just waiting on approval to go ahead and resolve the issue with this image. The exact source of the issue is located at:  
https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/b9d1886fb74bcf31973bc547a788fd4de0d628e2/_config.yml#L70  
  
**CodeTriage**  
My experience with CodeTriage so far hasn't been life changing. Possibly because I've only receeived one or two emails so far.  
I signed up for matplotlib and django. I've used both on a handful of occasions (and didn't know either of them were open source until recently).  
Out of the few issues I did examine, the two that caught my interest were:  
https://github.com/django/django/pull/9546  
https://github.com/django/django/pull/9351  
In both cases, responses seem to be pretty quick and people encourage using helpful links instead of deterring anyone trying to help. Regarding both issues (well one of them is technically a new feature, the other is a bug), more information can be obtained at https://code.djangoproject.com/, which is django's primary bug tracker. People submit tickets here, with github serving as a mode of communication for pull requests, not a place for reporting issues. Using the bug tracking site that the pull requests referenced I was able to obtain more information regarding what was being fixed. One is a new filter feature for django admins, the other is an issue regarding pathing issues and how django detects the language for a user
  
Another issue that caught my attention was:  
https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/9653  
The response times on this issue were much slower relative to the issues I was browsing on the django github (django however is a much more active project). Everyone here is also very professional and also detail oriented. The issue itself revolves around saving svg files on a certain operating system, and the issue seems to be potentially due to the permissions required and the way cache is accessed or written to. The problem eventually got marked as difficult by the user who commented "Someone would have to spend some time on this I think."
