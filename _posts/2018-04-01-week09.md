# Questions for Danna Kelmer
1. What open source projects does Google currently support?
2. Which open source projects at Google are you working on?
3. What open source humanitarian projects would you work on if you got paid to work on them?
4. What are your thoughts on the usage of open source software in public education?

# Progress Report
Regarding the group project, I'm still looking for suitable bugs to work on in django. I've located some easy tickets that might be *potentially* resolvable by our group, but we're not sure yet. I'm still browsing more django tickets, to see if there are tickets that aren't labeled as easy and haven't been touched in a while, but we might be able to work on. I think my group members are considering alternative projects to django to work on. By later this week we'll either commit to django or pick an alternative project
