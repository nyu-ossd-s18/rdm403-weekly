Made my first Wikipedia edit!  
  
Originally I was looking for information about Churi, an Indian dessert, but was unable to find it. I did some digging on the origins of it and tried to see if I could find more info on it under different pages, since it did not have a page of its own.  
  
After some browsing I ended up on a page about Punjabi dhabas which looked like it needed some updating. Dhabas are essentially street food vendors and my personal favorite spots to get food from while I am in India.  
  
The contribution I made to the page was just adding in some missing links. Due to the way different languages within India are romanized, cultural and traditional words might be spelled differently based on different sources. That appeared to be the case for some of the missing links. The words were spelled slightly differently in the article, but pages already existed for those foods on Wikipedia. They just weren't automatically linked together or suggested due to variations in spelling.
