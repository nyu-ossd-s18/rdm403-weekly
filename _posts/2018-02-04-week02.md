Explain (in your own words) the difference between software development following the cathedral model and software development following the bazaar model; which of the two environments would you be more comfortable.  
  
The bazaar model relies on a community of developers and a unique, rapid style of development, while the cathederal model is the idea that great software is often built by a few developers working on it meticulously behind the scenes. The bazaar model allows for all code to be laid out, and relies on the fact that developers who want certain features or the project to grow in certain directions will help it do so using their own time and effort. This model allows for software to adapt and grow according to the needs of the community. The bazaar model relies on rapid and frequent releases, and with the combination of the number of users viewing the code, bugs are caught and fixed as soon as possible. The cathedral model loses out on this benefit by having to undergo the testing phases and attaining a (relatively) bug free status prior to release. 

The Cathedral and The Bazaar essay has 19 "lessons"; pick two that you found most interesting, intriguing, telling, or that you simply liked; quote them in your blog and try to explain what they supposed to mean.
