**Group Django**  
  
*Meeting Time: Tuesday (primary) and Thursday (secondary) 5-7 PM*  
  
*Strengths and Weaknesses*  
I think our collective strengths are that most of us have used django before, and thus have a working knowledge of what django shines at and what it fails to accomplish.  
Also, since we've done a project in django before, we know what features we wanted to see django have but didn't have available. If we can gather enough time and technical experience collectively as a group, we might be able to implement one of the features we wanted to see in the framework. Or the least we could do is submit a ticket requesting a new feature.  
  
*Milestones*  
I'm not sure of a long term list, but for the short term, we should definitely examine closed tickets to see what kind of problems have been marked as "Easy Pckings" in the past and which currently easy problems are avaiable.  
We should also have a look at the harder tickets and tickets requesting new features, not because we have any chance of being able to resolve/implement them, but they would help us gain prospective on what the django community wants to grow toward and what kind of perspective we should be adopting ad developers when looking at this project.  
  
**Events for Open Data Week**  
Currently planning on attending the event at NYU on Monday, along with the art exhibit and the ending celebration on Friday.
