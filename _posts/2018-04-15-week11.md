# Progress Report
For the group project, we have an issue to work on and have so far replaced the old common passwords list. So far I've written a script to format the new list to match the format of the previous list that we were replacing. I also wrote another script to locate old passwords that weren't on the new list and appended them to the end of the file. I opted to keep the new common passwords list in order of popularity, as it was found from teh new source, and appended any missing passwords from the old file onto the end of the new one (because they weren't popular enough to be in the new list to begin with). Ideally this ordering speeds up the password validation in django. I also ran some tests along with my group mates to see if we were all getting the same results on the testing. The django unit tests for the password validator look outdated, so we might take the opportunity to add a few new ones in by using some of the suggestions we received from the mailing list/chat channel/issue comments. I'm not sure if rewriting and/or adding new unit tests is my task or someone elses.

# Contributions This Week
Commented on a few issues this week, adding them to the Contributions table. 2 of them were comments on open issues (that hopefully should be closed soon) in pyautogui, a python module that allows for programmed keyboard and mouse input.
